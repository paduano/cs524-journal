                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p class="summary">
                    A compound graph is a frequently encountered type of data set. Relations are given between items, and a hierarchy is defined on the items as well. We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations.

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p class="summary">

                It has been noticed in the 20th century a shift in visualization research. Once that the fundamental problem are solved, new directions needs to be explored.<br>
                    Thanks to the new technologies new approaches and possibilities are available. The essay is a vast overview of the most significant and unsolved problems.
                <h5> Human Centered Challenges </h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Interdisciplinary collaboration</b><br>
                            Researchers in the visualization field must work closely to the domain experts. Cover the gap
                        </li>

                        <li> <b>Evaluation of usability</b><br>
                            Software usability. Skepticism for the human-centered evaluation, they are time consuming and error prone. Hard to design and to implement
                        </li>

                        <li> <b>Finding the most effective visual metaphors</b><br>
                            Represent an abstract data with a geometry. Huge collection of solutions. It seems to be one of the most important challenges in the
                            field of visualization. Is difficult to achieve a representation that is intuitive, scalable and represents high dimensional data
                        </li>

                        <li> <b>Choosing optimal levels of visual abstraction</b><br>
                            Optimal is user dependent. But the general guideline is <i>Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand</i>, the
                            so-called "Visual Information Seeking Mantra".
                        </li>

                        <li> <b>Collaborative visualization</b><br>
                            Need to share the visualization with another user, possibly in different locations. Of course this challenge does not exist in
                            simple static visualization, but it might be non-trivial for more complex interactive visualizations. Eg. who is in charge
                            to control the visualization, how to communicate between users, how to deal with the network latency, security and display technologies?
                        </li>

                        <li> <b>Effective interaction</b><br>
                            New interactions that overcame the limitation of the keyboard and the mouse. Controlling the computer with hand gestures,
                            speaking.
                        </li>

                        <li> <b>Representing data quality</b><br>
                            Every piece of data has always a certain level of quality, or a degree of uncertainty. This is an information that visualization tools should show.
                            So far, a large amount of visualizations simply does not care of this aspect.
                        </li>


                    </ul>

                <h5> Technical Challenges </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Scalability and large data management</b><br>
                        As the data set grows, design and develop a suitable tool becomes more and more challenging.
                        Not only for the limited hardware or the processing speed, but especially for the visualization algorithm perspective.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>High data dimensionality and time-dependent data</b><br>
                        Data can have up to hundred of dimensions. On a screen we can easily represent few dimensions, in order to get more we need to
                        find new kind of representations. <br>
                        Time is an additional dimension, but it is often threaten in a different way, for instance by adding animation to the visualization.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Data filtering</b><br>
                        As the quantity of data grow, it is necessary to find suitable ways to filter the data. Although various techniques for
                        feature extraction and data reduction exists, it is an open problem how to detect end filter interesting data.
                     </li>
                    <li> <b>Cross-plataform visualization</b><br>
                        Unfortunately, the visualization tools are still platform dependent. Graphical acceleration relies on the type of graphic card,
                        certain visualization might rely on the screen quality, or even on the type of OS.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <h5> Financial Challenges </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Evaluating effectiveness and utility in practice</b><br>
                        It is hard to understand how to invest the money on visualization researches. It is difficult to
                        pin down which researches are worth it.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Introducing standards and benchmarks</b><br>
                        Whereas other areas of computer science have their own benchmarks to measure the performance of a given solution, the Data Visualization
                        field still lacks of such a standardized way to measure the goodness of a solution.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>From research into practice</b><br>
                        A whole set of challenges stand between the research and prototyping and the real application, such as interdisciplinary communication problems,
                        scalability, usability.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p class="abstract">
                    Since scientific discoveries and engineering
                    innovation produce broad benefits,
                    improved tools that advance individual,
                    group, and social creativity are important
                    contributions. The current and
                    forthcoming generations of programming,
                    simulation, information visualization,
                    and other tools are empowering
                    engineers and scientists just as animation
                    and music composition tools have invigorated
                    filmmakers and musicians (see the sidebar “New Media Arts and the
                    Future of Technologies”). These and many other creativity support tools
                    enable discovery and innovation on a broader scale than ever before; eager
                    novices are performing like seasoned masters and the grandmasters are producing
                    startling results. The accelerating pace of academic research, engineering
                    innovation, and consumer product design is amply documented in
                    journal publications, patents, and customer purchases.
                </p>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p class="summary">
                    Creativity supports tools are like microscopes. They extend the perceptual abilities of the researcher. <br>
                    Traditional tools such business productivity tools differ from the creativity tools in terms of user iteration complexity and validation requirements.
                    Indeed, their interface is often well structured and their measure of success can be easily estimate by considering the number of tasks,
                    or the mistakes in a time frame. <br>
                    The field of application for creativity support tools is extremely wide. Some application are meant to support discovery by scientists, or prototype software for engineers,
                    even models for architects or sketches for artists.  <br>
                    Creativity is traditinally considered as a rare talent, but nowadays general tought is that everybody can be creative. This is the positive effect of web,
                    of the exchanging information and new communication technologies. Furthermore, it can't be neglected the effect of a different approach to students education. <br>
                    Three different way to see creativity:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Structuralist: people who believe that creativity comes from following rules</li>
                        <li>Inspirationalists: people who consider that creativity require structures to be ignored</li>
                        <li>Situationalists: to be creative you have to be social</li>
                    </ul>

                    But the author report another very intriguing definition of creativity. Csikszentmihalyi consider that creativity is an individual effort but can be considered creative only when it considered
                    positively by the community. Thus, he gives to the social acceptance a fundamental role. <br>
                    Furthermore, the essay briefly discuss about which are the key individuals and what type of changed it is expected in order to
                    turn in action a creativity tool: Developers need to be more aware of the kind of innovation their efforts can lead to, Product manager must consider their user as "creators", and Researches
                    have a major role in accepting the new tool and to assist its development.  <br>
                    Lastly, the essay points out the key aspects of a creativity support tool: the exploring, collaborations and history keeping, indeed creation require a lot of attempts and experiments.

                <p class="abstract">
                    Computing and visualizing sets of elements and their relationships is one of the most common tasks one performs when analyzing and organizing large amounts of data. Common representations of sets such as convex or concave geometries can become cluttered and difficult to parse when these sets overlap in multiple or complex ways, e.g., when multiple elements belong to multiple sets. In this paper, we present a design study of a novel set visual representation, LineSets, consisting of a curve connecting all of the setʼs elements. Our approach to design the visualization differs from traditional methodology used by the InfoVis community. We first explored the potential of the visualization concept by running a controlled experiment comparing our design sketches to results from the state-of-the-art technique. Our results demonstrated that LineSets are advantageous for certain tasks when compared to concave shapes. We discuss an implementation of LineSets based on simple heuristics and present a study demonstrating that our generated curves do as well as human-drawn ones. Finally, we present two applications of our technique in the context of search tasks on a map and community analysis tasks in social networks.

                    The “common” way to visualize which elements belongs to a set is the Euler and Venn diagram.  (If you don’t know the difference between Euler and Venn diagram visit : http://blog.visual.ly/euler-and-venn-diagrams/).
                    They have some inherent limitation. If the number of sets and elements it too high complex concave shapes must be used and this lead to poor readability.
                    LineSet are a way to represent sets which consists in lines which pass through each element of the set.  They works extremely well (wrt the standard visualization techniques) when there are multiple intersection.
                    LineSet implementation uses LKH travelling salesman heuristic in order to compute the shortest line which goes through all the data points.

                    The main concept of LineSet is to use line crossing instead visual overlap to identify set intersection. Eulero and Venn Diagram are intuitive tools but limited.
                    LineSet seems to be a good solution for some visualization. They of course have some drawbacks:
                <ul>
                    <li>A line suggest an ordering. A viewer might mistakenly think that there is some kind of ordering of the elements of the set</li>
                    <li>Do not capture the “space”. A line is one dimensional. The popular Eulero diagrams highlight a region of the space where the elements are located. A Lineset is less effective for this kind of visualization, but in some circumstances the position of the elements of the set is arbitrary.</li>
                    <li>The cardinality of the set can be effectively visualized thanks to the size of the Eulero set. LineSets visualize the cardinality of the set with the length of the line.</li>
                </ul>
